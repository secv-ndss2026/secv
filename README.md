# SECV: Securing Connected Vehicles with Hardware Trust Anchors.
This is the open-source for the SECV: Securing Connected Vehicles with Hardware Trust Anchors, NDSS 2026 Fall paper.
Here, we will provide the instructions on building SECV for S32G3.

## Caution and Disclaimer:
This is only a prototype and is not production-ready. We only provide a proof of concept for the research conducted as presented in the paper.
Additionally, especially for S32G3, some of the required firmware requires Licenses, and thus, we are not permitted to distribute them. But one may obtain most of the needed firmware with a free account on NXP.
